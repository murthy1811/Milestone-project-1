## Strategy

### User Needs.

User should access the website on all devices and should be easy enough to navigate and get all the info needed

#### Technical limitations

Current project is only designed to be static. There is lot of scope to improve the content and features. For example, after the user registers oneself, there can be detailed information popped out
like when and where he can be vaccinated. This is out of scope for current Milestone 1 project. Only HTML and CSS are used.



## Scope

To attract lot of traffic and get registrations,  as the District Government body goal is to vaccinate as many people as they can. It is important to get all social media links function properly 
and to reach wider audience, everything should be smoother and simpler.

## Structure

With a welcoming text of explaining what this website is about and navigation links to Registration, contact and all latest press releases about COVID-19, site is designed 
to let user act upon quickly. Main page should be able to address the simple concerns of the user on how the vaccine works and if it is safe. 

The registration page should warn the user on, when can he expect the vaccine and how the information will reach him. 

Contact page should provide all the ways, apart from Social media( which is in Footer) and means of reaching the authorities on concerns, and queries.

The physical location should be there on main page as well, to direct the users if they want to talk to someone directly

Footer contains the social media info.
